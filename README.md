# Rschistox

This is a package for modelling schistosomiasis treatment in low to high prevalence settings. 
The model can be used for both S.haematobium and S. mansoni, and also for treatment of:
- Pre school aged children (pre-SAC)
- School aged children (SAC)
- Adult population

The model allows the user to specify the proportion of population receiving treatment of praziquantel to the three groups mentioned above, and the efficacy of the treatment.
It is also modelled to accomodate vaccination, once available for use.

To dowloand the package in R, do the following:
- install devtools
'install.packages("devtools")'

devtools::install_github("mutono/Rschistox")
